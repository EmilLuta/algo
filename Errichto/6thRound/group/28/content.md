Any convex polygon is the sum of some triangles
Convex and concave polygons -- focus on convex.
Degrees < 180 -- convex polygon (normal kind)

Area of a triangle -- 2 vectors
Cross product:
x1 y1
x2 y2
x1 * y2 - x2 * y1
Area is half of the value -- abs(cross product) / 2;

Convex -- transform it into triangles by picking a pivot point A.
Compute area of each, by getting the vectors.

AB * AC = negative => B is more to the left than C, with respect to A
first * left = negatives => A is more to the left
