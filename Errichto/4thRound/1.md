Whenever we do the longest/ shortest subsequence most likely it is 2 pointers.

VERSION 1:

int j = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    // [i,j-1] too short, [i,j] too long
    while([i,j] is too short) {
        j++;
    }
    ans = min/max(ans, j-i/*+1*/);
}


VERSION 2:

int i = 0, j = 0;
while(i < n && j < n) {
    if([i,j] too long) {
        i++;
    }
    else {
        j++;
    }
    ???
}

HW
Try both 2 pointers
