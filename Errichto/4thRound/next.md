    - If you have multiple cooking times at the same point, it's optimal to lay them around the value. Now, this would be a good solution if we could have the field from -infinity to infinity. The problem is that we have from 1 to infinity. In this case, if multiple cooking times flock under the same point and you can't spread to the left, you have to start with the left first. :/

    - Obviously not going to work. Want to discuss an approach to it.
Don't unwrap the structure
O(Q * log(N))
O(Q * 26 * log(N))

    - You brute forced a TLE solution. :/

# Easier to approach

1. https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc183/tasks/abc183_c
    - Just think it through, can be brute forced

2. https://binarysearch.com/room/Weekly-Contest-33-4a6UMqz2er?questionsetIndex=1
    - How do you decide which goes first?

3. https://codeforces.com/contest/1447/problem/C
    - Knapsack, think it through, first

4. https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc183/tasks/abc183_b
    - You had a working solution for non-negatives, extrapolate it

5. https://codeforces.com/contest/1452/problem/B
    - You had some thoughts on how to approach it, but they were not very conclusive. Couldn't decide how to solve it as a human being. Can't implement that.

6. https://codeforces.com/contest/1454/problem/E
    - You should give it a try

7. https://binarysearch.com/room/Weekly-Contest-35-NOnJq4qGRb?questionsetIndex=2
    - Problem I haven't tried yet.

8. https://codeforces.com/contest/1455/problem/D
    - Same as above

9. LIS - Longest Increasing Subsequence
    - Study

10. Coordinate compression

11. https://codeforces.com/contest/1453
    - Missed a CF round, duh!

12. https://binarysearch.com/room/Weekly-Contest-36-ngNTQirTtw?questionsetIndex=2
    - You can't just look back for prev, you gotta go the entire chain. Think it through. Can be solveable. Maybe a go right while possible?

13. https://codeforces.com/contest/1450
    - Missed yet another CF round...

14. https://codeforces.com/contest/1461
    - Missed another fuckin' CF round!

15. https://codeforces.com/contest/1462
    - Make sure its last?

16. https://codeforces.com/contest/1463
    - Wow, you really suck. Couldn't even solve A. :)

17. https://codeforces.com/contest/1459
    - C'mon

18. https://codeforces.com/contest/1466/problem/E
    - I just need to look more into it. Barely made progress due to work. :/

19. https://codeforces.com/contest/1472/problem/E
    - We got the brute force, gotta optimise it now.

20. https://codeforces.com/contest/1467
    - Missed round. :o

# Problems to approach

1. https://codeforces.com/contest/1457/problem/D
    - Not sure how to deal with this one, yeah...

2. https://codeforces.com/contest/1454/problem/E
    - Worth it?

3. https://codeforces.com/contest/1437/problem/D
    - Hmph, not sure, think it through
